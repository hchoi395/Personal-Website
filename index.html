                            languages that I use most often are Java and JavaScript.

                                Firstly, I am taking a database systems course (CS 4400) where we are learning
                                about databases and SQL using mySQL. There are 4 phases of our project
                                that requires us to design and implement a database application in mySQL
                                Relational Database Management System.<br>
         
         
                                Secondly, I am also taking Computer Graphics (CS 3451) where we are learning and
                                utilizing Processing (with Java) to build projects utilizing strong linear
                                algebra and programming skills.<br>
                               
                                Thirdly, I am also taking Systems and Networking (CS 2200) where the goal of the course
                                is to explore computer system structure and networking including software
                                abstractions in operating systems for the usage of various computing resources.<br>
         
         
                                Fourthly, I am taking Junior Design (LMC 3432 / CS 3311), a 2 semester course where my group of 5 CS students
                                are currently in contact with a client (A Sip of Paradise Garden), a community of bartenders
                                and other hospitality members who enjoy leisure activities together such as gardening and yoga.
                                We were given the assignment of implementing ASOP Community Connect, a social media platform
                                that will centralize the community's information into a application which allows users to
                                create a profile, schedule / view upcoming events, pay member dues, and post information for potential donors.
